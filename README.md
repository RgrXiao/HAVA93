My project is to code a clothing website for my aunt.
My goal is to try to replicate the features from similar websites.

The website will mainly feature a page to display the many clothing items
as well as different categories for users to narrow their search.
Users will be able to sort the results based on price and brand.

Items could be added to a shpping cart page with the user's chosen size.
Once on the cart, users should be able to modify the cart by removing unwanted items.
A wishlist is to be implemented as well and users will be able to move items from it to the cart or to remove any item from it.
I want to implement a checkout option that can enable the users to pay with PayPal.
An email will be sent to the user confirming the transaction.
The owner if the website will be getting a notification via email of any orders made.

Aesthetically, the goal is forn the website to look alive and not boring.

I will be using HTML, PHP, Javascript, and CSS to code the website.
