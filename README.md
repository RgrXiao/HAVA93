My project is to code a clothing website for my aunt.
My goal is to try to replicate the features from similar websites.

The website will mainly feature a page to display the many clothing items
as well as different categories for users to narrow their search.
Users will be able to sort the results based on price and brand.

Items could be added to a shpping cart page with the user's chosen size.
I want to implement a checkout option that can enable the users to pay with PayPal.

Aesthetically, the goal is forn the website to look alive and not boring.

I will be using HTML, PHP, Javascript, and CSS to code the website.
