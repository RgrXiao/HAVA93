*View.php is created with 3 products that are hard coded but not yet pulled from any database. 
*slide.css is created so that a user can hover over a product to see a form where they can choose size and quantity, add notes, and there's an add to cart button that is non-functional still.
*index.css is created for styling all the pages on the website.
*header.html is modified with a menu out of which only Home and Produts are functional.
*footer.html is created and for now it just includes a way to contact me by email.

*Created database to store product items and their attributes.
*View.php now displays the products from the database instead of being hardcoded like they were previously.
there is only one product as I am trying to come up with a way to display the colors available for a particular product.
*Created categories.html and categories.css to provide a way for users to click a button and get displayed items in the categories they are intrested on
such as Men, Women, and Summer. As of now, the buttons do not do anything.
